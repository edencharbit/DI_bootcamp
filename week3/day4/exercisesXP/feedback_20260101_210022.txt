suggestions for improvement:
- In the `__iadd__` method, when adding another `Currency` object, you're returning a new `Currency` object instead of modifying `self` and returning it. This is not how `__iadd__` should behave. `__iadd__` should modify the object in place and return the modified object itself.
- Consider adding more comprehensive testing, especially around edge cases or potential error conditions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only addresses Exercise 3. The other exercises (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7) are not implemented.
- For Exercise 3, consider using `''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for _ in range(5))` for a more concise and potentially faster string generation.
- The code lacks modularity and does not include any function definitions.
- The code doesn't include a solution for exercises 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

suggestions for improvement:
- The exercise asks to display the current date only, but the code prints the current date and time.  Modify the print statement to output only the date.
- Consider adding a docstring to the function to explain its purpose.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider including the hours, minutes, and seconds in the output for more accurate information. For instance, calculating the time difference in seconds using `diff.total_seconds()` and converting it to a human-readable format.
- Add Docstrings to the function to explain the functionality.
- The code can be made more concise by calculating the time difference directly without creating intermediate variables.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding type hints for better readability and maintainability.
