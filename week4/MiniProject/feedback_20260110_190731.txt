suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a set instead of a list for `self.word_lst` in the `__init__` method for faster lookups in `is_valid_word`.
- The `is_anagram` method is correctly implemented as a static method. No change needed.
- No improvements needed to address any security concerns within this context.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error handling (e.g., using try-except blocks for file operations).
- The code could be slightly more modular by extracting the input validation logic into a separate function.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided text appears to be the content of a word list, which is a data file, not code. It's not possible to evaluate the readability, performance, or security of a data file. The question requires Python code to perform tasks related to OOP, file I/O, string manipulation, and algorithm design related to anagrams. Since this submission is just data, it doesn't fulfill any of those requirements.
- This part of the file does not contain any code, and is just a text file, so most metrics do not apply.
- This submission is a text file containing a list of words, which is intended to be a word list for the Anagram Checker program. However, it doesn't include any code, and it only provides the word list data. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the instructions in the prompt, which requires code implementation for `anagram_checker.py` and `anagrams.py`.
